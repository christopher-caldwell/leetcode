# LeetCode Practice

Don't judge.

## Branches

`master` has all the questions, `solutions` has my solutions with potentially faster and more performant ones. 

The solutions are marked as such:
```ts
/** My solution
 * @speed 208 ms
 * @memory 48 MB
 */
function isPalindrome(x: number): boolean {...}
```

When a faster or better one is discovered through comments or googling, they will be marked as such.

## Setup

In case this is needed, lol.

```shell
yarn
```

## Testing Solutions

To run all the tests, run `yarn test`. Who could've guess this mystery command?
